            MY DEAREST BARBARA ALEXIEVNA,--How happy I was last night--how
            immeasurably, how impossibly happy! That was because for once in your
            life you had relented so far as to obey my wishes. At about eight
            o’clock I awoke from sleep (you know, my beloved one, that I always like
            to sleep for a short hour after my work is done)--I awoke, I say, and,
            lighting a candle, prepared my paper to write, and trimmed my pen. Then
            suddenly, for some reason or another, I raised my eyes--and felt my
            very heart leap within me! For you had understood what I wanted, you had
            understood what my heart was craving for. Yes, I perceived that a corner
            of the curtain in your window had been looped up and fastened to the
            cornice as I had suggested should be done; and it seemed to me that your
            dear face was glimmering at the window, and that you were looking at me
            from out of the darkness of your room, and that you were thinking of
            me. Yet how vexed I felt that I could not distinguish your sweet face
            clearly! For there was a time when you and I could see one another
            without any difficulty at all. Ah me, but old age is not always a
            blessing, my beloved one! At this very moment everything is standing
            awry to my eyes, for a man needs only to work late overnight in his
            writing of something or other for, in the morning, his eyes to be red,
            and the tears to be gushing from them in a way that makes him ashamed to
            be seen before strangers. However, I was able to picture to myself your
